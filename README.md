# rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock, paper, scissors game

The way it works is that there is the player and the AI. The player picks to play either rock, paper, or scissors. Then the AI picks as well, using a random number genraetor. The two choices are compared and the winner is determiend. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both the player and the AI pick the same thing, then the match ends in a tie.
